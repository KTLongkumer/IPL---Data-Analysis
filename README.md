# IPL---Data-Analysis
Let's start by loading and exploring the datasets to understand their structure and contents. Then we can proceed with the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

### Steps:

1. **Load the datasets**.
2. **Explore the datasets** to understand the structure, column names, and data types.
3. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)**:
    - Descriptive statistics
    - Missing values analysis
4. **Answer specific questions** through analysis and visualizations.

Let's start by loading and examining the contents of the datasets.

The datasets have been successfully loaded and inspected. Here are their structures:

### Matches Dataset

The `matches_df` DataFrame includes information on individual matches with columns like:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the match
- `city`: City where the match was played
- `date`: Date of the match
- `player_of_match`: Best player of the match
- `venue`: Venue of the match
- `team1` and `team2`: Teams playing the match
- `toss_winner`: Team that won the toss
- `toss_decision`: Decision taken after winning the toss (bat/field)
- `winner`: Winning team
- `result`: Result type (runs/wickets)
- `result_margin`: Margin of victory
- Other columns like `eliminator`, `method`, `umpire1`, and `umpire2`

### Ball-by-Ball Dataset

The `ball_by_ball_df` DataFrame includes detailed information on every ball bowled in each match with columns like:

- `id`: Match identifier
- `inning`: Inning number
- `over` and `ball`: Over and ball number within the over
- `batsman`, `non_striker`, and `bowler`: Players involved
- `batsman_runs`, `extra_runs`, and `total_runs`: Runs scored on the ball
- `non_boundary`, `is_wicket`, `dismissal_kind`, `player_dismissed`, and `fielder`: Wicket details
- `extras_type`: Type of extra run (if any)
- `batting_team` and `bowling_team`: Teams involved

Next, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We'll address the following points:

1. Descriptive statistics for both datasets.
2. Checking for missing values.
3. Specific analyses and visualizations to answer potential questions such as:
    - Most successful teams.
    - Best individual performances.
    - Distribution of runs, wickets, etc.
    - Trends over the years.

Let's start with the descriptive statistics and checking for missing values in the datasets. 

### Descriptive Statistics and Missing Values Analysis

### Matches Dataset (`matches_df`):

- **Number of records**: 816 matches
- **Key points**:
    - `city`: Contains 803 non-missing values, with Mumbai being the most frequent city.
    - `player_of_match`: 812 non-missing values, with AB de Villiers being the most frequent.
    - `venue`: No missing values, Eden Gardens being the most common venue.
    - `team1` and `team2`: No missing values, with Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians being the most frequent teams.
    - `toss_winner` and `winner`: Both have no missing values.
    - `result_margin`: 17 missing values.
    - `method`: 797 missing values, likely due to matches ending without specific methods like D/L.

### Ball-by-Ball Dataset (`ball_by_ball_df`):

- **Number of records**: Extensive, detailed per ball (more than 193,000 records).
- **Key points**:
    - `dismissal_kind` and `player_dismissed`: High number of missing values (183,973).
    - `fielder`: High number of missing values (186,684).
    - `extras_type`: High number of missing values (183,235).
    - `bowling_team`: 191 missing values.

###1. What was the count of matches played in each season?

To determine the count of matches played in each season from the provided datasets, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Load the matches data into a DataFrame.
2. Extract the season information.
3. Count the number of matches for each season.

Here's a step-by-step outline of how you can do this using Python and pandas:

1. **Load the Data**: Load the matches data from the CSV file.
2. **Extract and Count**: Use pandas to group the data by season and count the number of matches per season.

###2. How many runs were scored in each season?
   To determine how many runs were scored in each IPL season, we need to aggregate the runs scored for all matches in each season. We will use the ball-by-ball dataset to sum up the runs for each match and then group them by season.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

Load the ball-by-ball dataset.
Extract the season information from the matches dataset and merge it with the ball-by-ball data to associate each ball with a season.
Aggregate the total runs scored in each season.
Let's perform this analysis.

###3. What were the runs scored per match in different seasons?
To calculate the average runs scored per match in different seasons, we will:

Load both the ball-by-ball and matches datasets.
Extract the season information from the matches dataset.
Merge the ball-by-ball data with the season information.
Calculate the total runs for each match.
Calculate the average runs per match for each season.

​8. Does winning the toss imply winning the game?
To determine if winning the toss has a significant impact on winning the game, we need to analyze the relationship between toss winners and match winners. Specifically, we will compare the number of matches won by the team that won the toss versus the team that lost the toss.

Here's the step-by-step approach for performing this analysis:

a.Load the matches dataset.
b.Create a new column to indicate if the toss winner is the same as the match winner.
c.Calculate the number of matches won by the toss winner and the number of matches won by the team that lost the toss.
d.Analyze the results to see if there's a significant difference.

23. Who has hit the most number of 6's?
    To find out which batsman has hit the most number of sixes in the IPL, we need to analyze the ball-by-ball data and count the instances where a batsman hit a six.
    Batsmen who have hit the most number of sixes in the IPL:
            batsman  number_of_sixes
63         CH Gayle              349

24. Who has the highest strike rate?
    To determine the batsman with the highest strike rate in the IPL, we need to calculate the strike rate for each batsman. The strike rate is calculated as:

Strike Rate
=
(
Total Runs
Total Balls Faced
)
×
100
Strike Rate=( 
Total Balls Faced
Total Runs
​
 )×100

We will need to sum the total runs and count the total balls faced for each batsman, and then compute their strike rate.
Batsmen with the highest strike rate in the IPL:
